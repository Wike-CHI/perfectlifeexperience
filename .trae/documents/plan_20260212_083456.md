# Admin System Implementation Plan (OpenSpec Workflow)

Based on your request to use the OpenSpec workflow for the `admin_dash` project, I have outlined the following 4-phase plan. We will proceed phase by phase, confirming with you after each step.

## Phase 1: Requirements Document & Acceptance Criteria
**Goal**: Standardize requirements using EARS syntax and define UI specifications.
1.  Create `specs/admin_system/requirements.md`.
2.  Translate functional modules (Dashboard, Product, Order, User, Promotion, Finance) from `ADMIN_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` into **EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)**.
    *   *Example*: "While on the Order List page, when the user selects 'Ship', the system shall display the shipping information entry modal."
3.  Define **UI Design Specifications** strictly following `rules/ui-design/rule.md`.
    *   Purpose Statement, Aesthetic Direction, Color Palette, Typography, Layout Strategy.

## Phase 2: Technical Solution Design
**Goal**: detailed technical architecture and database design.
1.  Create `specs/admin_system/design.md`.
2.  **Architecture**: Confirm UniApp (Vue 3 + TS) + CloudBase architecture.
3.  **Database Design**: Define schema for new collections (`admins`, `withdrawals`, `operation_logs`) and extensions to existing ones (`users`, `orders`).
4.  **Cloud Functions**: Define necessary cloud function extensions (e.g., `admin-api` or extending existing functions for admin privileges).
5.  **Security**: Define RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and data permission strategies.

## Phase 3: Task Breakdown
**Goal**: Create a granular implementation roadmap.
1.  Create `specs/admin_system/tasks.md`.
2.  Break down the project into small, testable tasks.
    *   *Example*: "Implement Login Page", "Implement Product List API", "Develop Order Shipping Modal".
3.  Prioritize tasks (P0: Core Business, P1: Promotion/Finance, P2: Analytics).

## Phase 4: Task Execution
**Goal**: Implement the system according to the plan.
1.  Execute tasks sequentially.
2.  Update `tasks.md` status in real-time.
3.  Perform self-audits (UI, Code Quality) before completion.

**Next Step**:
I will start **Phase 1** by creating `specs/admin_system/requirements.md` and defining the Requirements and UI Specifications.
